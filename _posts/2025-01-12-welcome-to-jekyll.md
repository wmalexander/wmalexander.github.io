After 25+ years in web development, I've seen the WordPress ecosystem evolve dramatically. What started as a simple blogging platform has become a robust CMS powering over 40% of the web.

## The Modern WordPress Landscape

Today's WordPress development goes far beyond themes and plugins. We're building:

- **Headless architectures** with WordPress as a content API
- **Custom Gutenberg blocks** for rich content experiences  
- **Enterprise solutions** that scale to millions of users
- **Integration platforms** connecting diverse systems

## Key Principles I Follow

Over the years, I've developed some core principles for WordPress development:

### Performance First
Every decision should consider its impact on site speed. This means optimizing queries, leveraging caching, and being mindful of asset loading.

### Security by Design
With WordPress being such a popular target, security can't be an afterthought. It needs to be built into every custom solution from the ground up.

### Maintainability Matters
Code that works today but can't be maintained tomorrow is a liability. I focus on clean, documented solutions that future developers (including myself) will thank me for.

## Looking Ahead

The WordPress ecosystem continues to evolve with full site editing, block themes, and modern JavaScript frameworks. The key is staying curious and adapting while keeping core principles intact.
