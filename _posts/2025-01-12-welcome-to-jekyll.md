Welcome to my new Jekyll-powered website! I've just migrated from a simple HTML site to Jekyll, and I'm excited about all the possibilities this opens up.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for blogs and personal websites. It's built into GitHub Pages, which means you get free hosting with automatic builds whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Why Jekyll?

Here are a few reasons I chose Jekyll:

- **Simplicity**: Write content in Markdown, and Jekyll converts it to HTML
- **Flexibility**: Full control over layouts and styling
- **No Database**: Everything is static, so the site loads super fast
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic deployment with GitHub Pages
- **Blog-aware**: Built-in support for blog posts, categories, and tags

## What's Next?

I'm planning to use this space to share:

- Technical tutorials and guides
- Project updates and case studies
- Thoughts on software development
- Interesting problems and their solutions

## Code Example

Jekyll also makes it easy to share code snippets with syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from Jekyll!")
    return "Welcome to my blog"

# Call the function
message = hello_world()
print(message)
```

Stay tuned for more content as I continue to build out this site!
