I've spent over two decades building and managing websites for colleges and universities, both as an in-house web developer and as an external consultant. In that time, I've worn many hats: part IT specialist, part communicator, part educator. My career started in the late 1990s, when university websites were a novelty – often just a few static pages maintained by whoever had a bit of HTML knowledge on campus. Back then, some schools even needed convincing to launch a website at all. Fast forward to today, and every institution sees its web presence as mission-critical. This journey has given me a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities in higher ed web development. In this article, I want to share lessons learned from 25 years in the field, reflecting on how far we've come and where we're headed.

Working on campus web teams (currently at Wake Forest University) and consulting for other institutions (like Sweet Briar College and others) taught me that higher education presents distinct challenges that you might not find in the corporate world. Yes, we deal with code and servers, but we also navigate committee meetings, academic calendars, shoestring budgets, and the expectations of a whole campus community. The work is equal parts technical and human. I've learned that building a great university website isn't just about choosing the right software – it's about understanding higher ed culture, balancing competing needs, and planning for the long haul. Before diving into WordPress and the role it plays, let's set the stage by looking at how campus web development has evolved from the early "brochure site" days to the complex digital ecosystems we manage now.

## The Evolution of University Web Needs: From Brochure Sites to Digital Ecosystems

When I built my first university webpages in the late '90s, they were essentially online brochures. The goal was simple: publish static information online so prospective students or donors could read about the school. Our sites were small, mostly text and a few images, and updated infrequently. In fact, the earliest college sites often just duplicated content from print catalogs or viewbooks. Back then, "web development" might mean uploading some HTML files via FTP and calling it a day. Looking back now, those early sites were modest in scope, but they set the foundation for everything to come.

As the 2000s and 2010s rolled on, universities realized a website could do much more than just present information. Campus websites evolved into dynamic digital ecosystems that serve many audiences: prospective and current students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents, and the public. A modern university web presence isn't a single website at all – it's a constellation of connected sites and online services. Yes, you still have the main www.university.edu site as the front door ("the first building a prospective student walks into," as one marketer put it). But now that front door leads to a whole campus of web content: admissions portals, academic department sites, research center microsites, online course catalogs, faculty blogs, event calendars, and more.

I've witnessed this growth firsthand. One college website I worked on started as a lean site of maybe 500 pages; over time it ballooned to thousands of pages as content needs grew. It's not unusual for a university's web content to sprawl – one web manager described how a site launched with 5,000 pages expanded to 20,000 pages within a few years! Moreover, those pages are now intertwined with other digital systems. Our websites must integrate with customer relationship management (CRM) systems for recruitment, learning management systems (LMS) for online classes, social media feeds for marketing, and myriad other tools. In short, the campus web has transformed from a standalone brochure into the hub of an entire digital ecosystem. This evolution brought immense new capabilities – and a lot more complexity.

## Common Higher Ed Web Challenges

Building and maintaining websites in higher education isn't easy. Over the years, I've encountered a set of recurring challenges that campus web teams everywhere will recognize. In this section, I'll break down some of the most common hurdles – and why they're especially tricky in a university setting.

### Accessibility Compliance

First and foremost, accessibility is a must in higher education web development. Universities have legal and moral obligations to ensure their websites are usable by people of all abilities. In the U.S., recent regulations strengthened these requirements – for example, a 2024 Department of Justice rule now explicitly requires public colleges to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all web content and digital services. Non-compliance isn't just a theoretical worry; institutions risk lawsuits or loss of federal funding if their sites are inaccessible. But beyond legal compliance, it's simply the right thing to do. Approximately one in five college students has a disability, so an inaccessible website means shutting out a significant part of your community.

Meeting accessibility standards in a sprawling university web ecosystem can be challenging. You might have hundreds of content editors (many of them non-technical staff or faculty) adding content. Ensuring every page has proper headings, alt text, captioned videos, and keyboard-friendly navigation requires constant vigilance and training. I've learned that accessibility can't be an afterthought – it has to be baked into your web platform and processes. This means using a CMS like WordPress with accessible themes/plugins and performing regular audits. It also means educating everyone involved in web content, from student interns up to VPs, about why accessible design matters. The good news is that the higher ed community is increasingly aware of this. Many universities now emphasize "digital accessibility" as part of their core web strategy, not just as a box to tick. Still, it's an ongoing effort – one that requires institutional commitment and resources (often scarce, as we'll discuss) to do properly.

### Stakeholder Management and Governance

In higher ed, web governance and stakeholder management can be as challenging as the technical work – if not more so. Unlike a corporation where a web team might answer to a single marketing or IT leader, a university web team answers to the entire campus. There are many voices: admissions wants one thing, academic departments want another, the provost's office has opinions, so does athletics, and don't forget alumni relations, student groups, and faculty with personal websites. Balancing these interests is a delicate art. I often joke that half my job is translating between "marketing speak" and "academic speak," ensuring everyone feels heard while steering the project in a coherent direction.

During any major web project (say a redesign or CMS migration), questions arise: Who needs to be involved? Who has decision-making power versus advisory input? How do we avoid the dreaded "design by committee" while still getting buy-in? I've learned that transparency and communication are key. One web governance expert noted that "forget about picking a CMS – managing these [stakeholder] issues can easily be one of the most overwhelming parts of a redesign." In my experience, that's spot on. I've seen projects stall because a department felt left out of the planning, or launch smoothly because we set up a clear governance structure from day one.

To manage stakeholders well, you need to establish roles and processes. For example, at one institution we created a Web Advisory Committee with representatives from various units to provide input and champion the project. We also set up a clear hierarchy: a core project team had final say, but we held open forums and updates so others could chime in. Regular communication – status newsletters, open meetings, even a project blog – can turn skeptics into supporters by giving them a window into the process. The lesson I carry forward is that web development is campus change management. People might resist change if sprung on them, but when you involve them early and show how the website aligns with institutional goals, you pave the way for smoother adoption. Yes, it's time-consuming, but ignoring stakeholder management can derail even the best technical plan.

### Legacy System Integration

Another common challenge in universities is dealing with legacy systems. Higher ed IT environments tend to be full of older, specialized systems: an ancient student information system, a decades-old faculty/staff directory database, or a proprietary content system that a department adopted long ago. When it's time to modernize the web presence, those legacy systems don't just disappear – we have to integrate or migrate them. I've encountered scenarios like needing to pull course descriptions from a 20-year-old database into a new website, or syncing WordPress content with a legacy portal that the campus just can't retire yet.

Integration work can be technically thorny. Often these legacy systems weren't built with modern APIs or integration in mind. We end up using creative solutions: batch exports and imports, iframes (not ideal), or custom middleware that translates data. One lesson I learned is to assess early on what systems the website needs to talk to. For instance, when we built a new WordPress-based site for a college, we had to ensure the events calendar could import events from the university's central calendar system (which was custom-built in the early 2000s). We wrote scripts to periodically fetch and update events, making it seamless to the end user. But behind the scenes, it was a small saga of wrangling formats and date quirks.

Legacy integration isn't just technical – it's also political. Sometimes an outdated system is somebody's baby. You have to diplomatically make the case for phasing it out or investing in integration work. Universities also have tight budgets, and replacing a big legacy system (like the main student system) can be prohibitively expensive and risky. So, web teams often live in a hybrid world: part modern CMS, part legacy backend. The key lesson is to plan for these integrations (they will take more time than you think) and to advocate whenever possible for data standardization and API-driven systems when new tools are acquired. Each legacy connector you build is technical debt that hopefully can be retired in the future, but you need a plan in case it can't be.

### Academic Freedom vs. Brand Consistency

One unique tug-of-war in higher ed web development is balancing academic freedom with institutional brand consistency. Universities are proud of their brands – the logos, colors, messaging, and overall identity that present a unified image to the world. Consistency is important for marketing and communications, especially in student recruitment and fundraising. However, universities are also collections of independent minds and voices. Faculty members and departments often feel a sense of ownership over their content and how it's presented. The result? Tension between enforcing brand/web standards and allowing creative or academic expression.

I've seen this play out, for example, when a professor or research lab wants to create a website that deviates from the official templates. Perhaps they want a unique design or to use a certain logo for their project. From their perspective, the site serves a specific audience or scholarly purpose, and strict brand rules might feel limiting. From the university's perspective, too much deviation can dilute the brand and confuse visitors. Who's right? In a way, both. The challenge is finding a compromise where essential brand elements (like accessibility, security, basic visual identity) are maintained while giving some flexibility for individual expression.

WordPress multisite (which we'll discuss soon) was one tool I've used to strike this balance. It allows a central team to provide a selection of approved themes and plugins (ensuring security and brand elements), while departments can have their own site within the network to populate as they wish. For instance, a science department could use a slightly customized theme that aligns with the university's brand but highlights their discipline's flavor. On one project, we developed a template system – essentially a family of themes – from very strictly branded to more open, and departments could choose based on their needs. We also drafted web guidelines that explicitly acknowledged academic freedom: faculty could, say, publish whatever content they liked (within reason), but if they were using the official web infrastructure, they needed to use the provided design framework. Some policies, like Park University's, explicitly state that they "recognize the exercise of academic freedom" while still aiming to "maintain brand consistency" on web platforms.

The lesson here is empathy and clarity. Empathize with your campus authors – understand why a one-size-fits-all site might not work for a quirky academic program – but also clearly communicate why some consistency helps everyone (for example, all sites being accessible and mobile-friendly, or having navigation that a user can understand when they jump between a department site and the main site). It's a balancing act, and it often requires case-by-case judgement calls. I've learned that listening goes a long way; often an unhappy faculty member just wants to be heard, and together you can find a solution that meets branding needs and their goals.

## Why WordPress Multisite Is a Game-Changer for Universities

Amid these challenges, one technology solution that I've found transformative in higher ed is WordPress Multisite. WordPress, of course, is the popular open-source content management system initially known for blogging and now powering all kinds of websites. Multisite is a feature of WordPress that allows you to run many sites from a single installation – essentially a network of sites that can share users, themes, and plugins. When I discovered WordPress Multisite (around a decade or so ago), it felt like it was made for universities.

Why? Think about the typical university's web environment: You don't have just one site, you have dozens or even hundreds. There's the main institutional site, plus sites for colleges, departments, research centers, admissions, library, athletics, etc., not to mention faculty or student blogs. In the early days, these might all have been separate little websites, hand-built by different people in different systems (one site in Dreamweaver, another in Joomla, another in pure HTML…). That chaos leads to inconsistency and a maintenance nightmare. WordPress Multisite offers a way to bring these under one roof without sacrificing the ability for each unit to have its own site.

With Multisite, a university can host all its sub-sites in a single platform. For example, at Sweet Briar College we implemented a WordPress multisite network to serve multiple needs under a unified system. This meant the main site and various sub-sites (for admissions, alumnae, etc.) all ran on one WordPress install, using a custom theme tailored to the college's brand. The benefits were immediate: we could update the theme or plugins once and update every site at the same time, ensuring consistency and saving a ton of maintenance effort. In fact, centralizing management like this is one of the key advantages of Multisite – an admin can control all sites from one dashboard, push security updates or new features across the board, and manage user access in one place.

For the non-technical stakeholders, WordPress Multisite was a game-changer in terms of empowerment. We could give a department its own site (say, history.example.edu) with the same look-and-feel and governance guardrails, but let them own their content. They log in, edit pages or add news posts, and they don't need to know anything about servers or HTML. Yet, because it's all in one network, the central web team can still oversee things – for instance, ensuring no one installs an insecure plugin or breaks the branding. I've heard it described as the best of both worlds: decentralization of content ownership with centralization of infrastructure.

To illustrate, I recall a case of a large university (not one I worked at directly, but shared in a conference) that had a network of over 1,000 microsites for various departments and initiatives. They used WordPress Multisite to enforce a common template and governance rules: "everyone got the same exact template… branding was exactly the same… and [department editors] could only control their site." This way, they maintained consistent design and branding, while still giving each unit a sense of ownership. The advantages reported were consistent branding across all sites, easy management of user roles, and the ability to roll out updates network-wide in one go. I've achieved similar outcomes on a smaller scale and can confirm how powerful that is. Imagine updating a university logo or adding a new header menu item across 50 sites – with Multisite you do it once, centrally, instead of touching 50 independent websites.

Of course, no technology is perfect. Multisite does require a bit more expertise to set up and manage, and you have to plan for the "noisy neighbor" problem – since all sites share the same server resources, one very busy site could impact others. In my experience, good hosting and monitoring mitigate this, and the benefits of unified management outweigh the downsides for many cases. In fact, 40% of higher ed institutions in a recent survey cited multisite support as a key reason they chose WordPress in the first place. It's become a backbone for many campus web operations. I consider WordPress Multisite a game-changer because it allowed my small web teams to do more with less – more sites, more consistency, with fewer people. When your staff and budget are limited (as is often true in education), that's invaluable.

## Real-World Examples and Lessons Learned

To ground these ideas, let me share a few real-world examples from my own experience. I'll talk about two institutions I've worked closely with – Sweet Briar College and Wake Forest University – and one additional client (an anonymized university) that faced an interesting web challenge. Each of these cases taught me something new.

### Sweet Briar College: Rebuilding on WordPress

Sweet Briar College is a small liberal arts college where I had the opportunity to consult on a major web overhaul. When I came in, Sweet Briar's web presence was fragmented – different parts of the college had sites that looked and behaved inconsistently. The college needed a more unified, modern web presence to support its recruitment and fundraising goals (especially after navigating some well-publicized institutional challenges in the mid-2010s). The solution we pursued was a WordPress Multisite network to host all of Sweet Briar's sites under one umbrella.

We developed a custom WordPress theme that captured Sweet Briar's brand identity – from typography and school colors to a design that evoked the campus's character – and made it multisite-compatible. With this single theme, we could spin up sites for various needs. The main college homepage and top-level sections were one site. Admissions got its own sub-site to tailor content to prospective students. The Alumnae office got another for engaging graduates. There was even a sub-site for a special program that had its own content team. All these lived in one WP multisite install.

The lesson I took from Sweet Briar's project was the importance of flexibility within consistency. Initially, some departments worried that being on a shared platform would limit what they could do. To address this, we built in customizable elements – for instance, the theme allowed choice of accent colors and a selection of layouts, so not every page looked cookie-cutter, even though they shared a common style guide. Training was another key: we ran workshops for staff to get comfortable with WordPress. Once they saw how easily they could create pages or add news without knowing code, they were on board. Post-launch, the feedback was that the college finally "felt" cohesive online; one alumna told us it was the first time the website really conveyed the spirit of Sweet Briar in a consistent way. Technically, maintaining the sites became easier for the central IT folks too – security updates, new features, all rolled out to the whole network at once. That project reaffirmed for me how WordPress (with Multisite) can level the playing field for a small institution, giving them enterprise-grade web infrastructure on a limited budget.

### Wake Forest University: Scaling and Governance

Switching gears, I'd like to talk about my current role at Wake Forest University. Wake Forest is a mid-sized university with a robust web ecosystem. Here, WordPress is used as a primary CMS for many official websites (we have a central WordPress environment managed jointly by our communications and IT teams). Wake Forest's web landscape is larger and more complex than Sweet Briar's, as you'd expect from a university with multiple colleges, graduate programs, and a sizable administrative structure.

One of the big lessons at Wake Forest has been about scaling governance and support. When you have hundreds of content contributors across campus – from professional staff to faculty who occasionally edit their profile pages – how do you ensure quality and consistency? Part of the answer for us has been a comprehensive WordPress training and support system. We maintain a "WordPress Guide" website with how-to documentation specific to our Wake Forest setup, covering everything from how to create a new page to which plugins are approved. We also require new site owners (usually department communications staff) to go through a training session before we hand over the keys. These steps echo what we see in industry surveys: while most universities provide basic CMS training, relatively few require ongoing training or formal onboarding for every site manager. We've found that investing in training up front saves us headaches later. People make fewer mistakes and are more confident using the tools, which means the content stays in better shape and we field fewer panicked support calls.

Another aspect is the governance structure. Wake Forest has a Web Advisory Committee that includes stakeholders from various divisions, which helps set high-level web strategy and policies. But day-to-day, our core web team has authority to enforce standards. For example, if a department wants to use a non-standard plugin or a design element that isn't accessible, we have a review process. Sometimes we have to say no – but importantly, we try to offer an alternative. I've learned the value of having documented web policies (covering accessibility, security, identity standards, etc.) so that when conflicts arise, it's not personal; we have guidelines to point to. This kind of governance is what keeps a large WordPress installation from descending into chaos. Everyone on our team, including myself, has to play diplomat at times – we work closely with our marketing/communications colleagues to ensure that the tech and content sides stay aligned.

Finally, Wake Forest has taught me about performance and sustainability at scale. With many sites and significant traffic (think major news releases or a surge of applicants checking application status), you discover quickly where the bottlenecks are. We've had to optimize our WordPress configuration, use caching and a content delivery network, and in some cases, allocate separate resources for very high-traffic sites. This is an area where being on a modern hosting platform helps. The landscape is shifting – today there are hosting solutions that give you the benefits of Multisite (central management) with the performance isolation of separate sites. We keep an eye on those developments, because the end goal is a fast, reliable experience for everyone. My key takeaway from the WFU context is that running WordPress in higher ed is not a "set and forget" operation; it's an evolving practice of fine-tuning the platform, training the people, and communicating continually. It's a lot of work, but it's rewarding to see our web presence grow in step with the university's needs.

### An Anonymized Client: Rapid Response and Adaptability

I also want to share a lesson from a recent consulting client – I'll keep the institution anonymous, but it was a mid-sized public university that came to me with an urgent problem. Their existing website (and associated microsites) were built on a proprietary CMS that was about to be discontinued by the vendor. They had less than a year to move everything to a new platform, or risk sections of their site breaking. The internal team was small and already stretched thin. We recommended a move to WordPress, given the timeline and resource constraints. Specifically, we set up a WordPress Multisite to host their multitude of department sites, and used a combination of an off-the-shelf theme framework for speed plus custom child themes to match their branding.

This project was a crash course in rapid deployment and adaptability. We didn't have time for perfection; we prioritized which sites and content were mission-critical (the admissions site and online application info came first, needless to say) and which could migrate later. One trick we used was a content freeze and import process: we wrote scripts to export content from the old CMS and import into WordPress for the initial migration, which saved a huge amount of manual copying/pasting. Even so, a lot of cleanup was needed. We trained student workers to assist with content proofreading and fixing formatting after import. It truly was an all-hands effort, with a hard deadline looming (the vendor's shutdown date).

The lesson from this case was that higher ed web teams need to be nimble and prepared for the unexpected. In a university, technology decisions sometimes get delayed or tangled in bureaucracy until there's no choice but a quick turn-around. WordPress turned out to be a good choice for agility – we stood up the environment quickly, leveraging the vast library of plugins for features like faculty directories and campus maps that we otherwise would never have had time to code from scratch. The project met the deadline, and the client's sites transitioned smoothly, but it was a reminder that technical debt (in this case, reliance on a single vendor product) can come due suddenly. It reinforced my belief in open-source solutions: you own your WordPress site and code, so you're less at the mercy of vendor whims. After the dust settled, the university's team was pleasantly surprised by how quickly they could learn and manage WordPress. It opened their eyes to a different way of working – one that's more iterative and user-friendly. For me, it was gratifying to see WordPress essentially rescue a university from a potential crisis, and it highlighted the importance of having a plan B for your web infrastructure.

## Future Trends for WordPress in Higher Ed

What does the future hold for WordPress in higher education? Standing here in 2025, I can say that WordPress has proven itself in this sector – but expectations are rising, and new trends are shaping how we approach campus web development.

One trend is the continued emphasis on **accessibility and inclusive design**. This isn't new, but it's only going to grow in importance. As noted earlier, regulations are tightening and the population of students with disabilities is increasing. A recent industry report on higher ed websites found that improving accessibility was the top priority cited for the coming year. This means web teams will be looking for better tools and practices to make sure their WordPress sites meet WCAG guidelines. I expect to see more integration of automated accessibility checking in content workflows, more accessible-ready WordPress themes, and perhaps greater awareness among content creators (maybe even required training in accessibility for anyone who edits a site). The community is calling for better accessibility tooling and it's likely we'll see progress on that front.

Another future trend is **workflow and governance enhancements**. As university web operations mature, there's demand for more sophisticated content workflows – things like multi-step approvals, content scheduling, and version control. Out of the box, WordPress has basic features, but I foresee more plugins and perhaps core improvements to handle complex editorial workflows that a large university might need. In the same survey, improving editorial workflows was high on the list of priorities for higher ed teams. There's also a push for better multisite management capabilities (should every little plugin update require a developer's hand, or can some tasks be delegated safely?). Even the WordPress project itself is being nudged by higher ed and enterprise users to improve in areas like user role management and overall governance of the platform. I take this as a sign that higher ed isn't just a passive consumer of WordPress; our needs are helping drive the ecosystem's evolution.

**Performance and scalability** will always be a concern, and as content becomes richer (high-res videos, interactive features, etc.), web teams will need to ensure sites remain fast and reliable. We may see more adoption of modern hosting solutions that give the benefits of both multisite and independent sites (some, like WP Cloud, are already touting this hybrid approach). There's also growing interest in headless or decoupled WordPress setups in higher ed – where WordPress is used as a content backend but a separate front-end framework delivers the site. A few pioneering schools are experimenting with this for better performance or design flexibility. However, I suspect most universities will stick with traditional WordPress for its simplicity unless they have very specific needs (like a mobile app pulling content from the CMS).

We can't talk about the future without mentioning **AI and personalization**. Everyone in tech is abuzz about AI in 2025, and higher ed is no exception. How might this intersect with WordPress? I can imagine AI tools helping web managers create content (e.g., drafting news stories or generating photo captions), or personalizing the user experience (e.g., showing different homepage content to a prospective student vs. a current student, based on some intelligent profiling). In fact, the higher ed web community is already discussing the disruption and opportunities AI brings. The recent survey data shows AI integration popping up as a trend on the radar. I'm cautiously optimistic here – AI won't replace the need for human strategy and storytelling, especially in something as personal as education, but it could assist us in analyzing user behavior or automating routine tasks. For WordPress specifically, we might see plugins that help suggest content improvements or ensure accessibility by using AI to flag issues.

Lastly, I think the future will involve **doubling down on fundamentals** even as new tech emerges. In other words, higher ed web teams are not just chasing the latest shiny objects; they're focused on sustainable, long-term improvements. The mantra I hear is maintainability. Budgets aren't getting dramatically bigger, so doing more with what we have is key. Universities are collaborating (through communities like WPCampus and EDUCAUSE) to share solutions, whether that's a great method to organize content or a custom plugin that several schools can reuse. There's a strong open-source spirit. A 2025 report summarized it well: "Universities aren't chasing trends; they're doubling down on inclusive design, efficient workflows, and long-term maintainability." That tells me that while we will certainly adapt WordPress to new needs, the core mission remains the same – provide an accessible, informative, and engaging digital experience for our campus communities.

## Key Takeaways

After 25 years in campus web development, here are some key lessons I'd highlight:

- **Websites are never "just websites" in higher ed** – they are mission-critical communications platforms that require both technical and organizational strategy. Treat web projects as change management across the institution, not just IT tasks.

- **Accessibility and inclusivity are non-negotiable.** From day one, bake accessibility into your web design and content processes. This isn't only to avoid lawsuits; it's about serving all users and living up to educational values.

- **Governance and stakeholder buy-in determine success.** Invest time in clear web governance structures, communication, and training. A fantastic CMS means little if campus users aren't on board or don't know how to use it. Remember that managing people and expectations can be the hardest part of a project.

- **WordPress (especially Multisite) can empower small teams.** The flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and multisite capabilities of WordPress make it a natural fit for universities. It allows a small web team to maintain a large, distributed web presence with consistency. That said, plan for its constraints (hosting, "noisy neighbors") and use good practices to mitigate them.

- **Balance consistency with creativity.** Aim for a coherent user experience across your university sites (unified branding, navigation, quality) while allowing individual units some flexibility to meet their audience needs. This balance keeps both the marketing folks and the academics reasonably happy.

- **Stay curious and adaptable.** The web and higher ed are both constantly evolving. Be ready to adopt new tools or approaches – whether that's integrating a new analytics tool, trying an AI assistant, or switching up your information architecture as user expectations change. What worked 10 years ago might not work now, and that's okay. Continuous improvement is part of the job.

In short, building great higher ed websites is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires a mix of technical savvy, empathy for your users and colleagues, adherence to standards, and a willingness to learn new tricks. The result, when done right, is rewarding – a web presence that truly furthers the educational mission and makes life easier for everyone who uses it.
